        <h2>A Crazy Start</h2>
        <p>
            I was planning on starting the day on Monday, but I was woken up from my wife. I had to take her to the hospital for an emergency surgery.<br>
            It was a long day. I arrived there at 3am. I didn't leave to go home until 6pm. I was exhausted. Now, I am playing catch-up.
