			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
                The purpose of the website is to help the ward members to have information about future activities.
                My calling in my ward is Ward Activities Committee Member. It is another tool for them to know and stay
                informed about the activities that are happening in the ward. Also, it would be great for the members to see past events on the website, so they can
                see the great memories made and want to be more apart of. This project will help me to magnify my calling. 
            </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
                JavaScript will help out by providing interactivity and enhancing the user experience on the website.
                I would like to have a calendar that shows upcoming activities with a countdown to the next activity.
                I would like to have a video/photos slideshow of past activities.
                I would like to give the user the choice to toggle between light and dark mode.
            </p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			Palette URL:
			<a

			<table class="colors">
