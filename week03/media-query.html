            <p>58 And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong,
                and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.<br>

                59 For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.</p>

            <h2>Doctrine & Convenants 45: 3-5</h2>
            <p>3 Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before himâ€”<br>

                4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; 
                behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;<br>
                
                5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</p>
